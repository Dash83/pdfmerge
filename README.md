# pdfmerge
Simple command line tool to merge pdf files.

I decided to write this simple tool since I needed to merge sensitive files that I was not willing to upload to an internet pdf merge service. 

For usage instructions, just run the script with the "--help" options.

Requirements:

*Must have Python 2.7 installed in the target system.
*Must have PyPDF2 module installed. I recommend installing this module with "pip install PyPDF2".
